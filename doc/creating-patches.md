A few guidelines for patches:
* first tell me whether your code is a bug fix or a feature
* describe your changes at a high level. if you are fixing a bug, you
need to convince me that the current behavior is buggy and not simply
inconvenient for you
* if your patch adds a feature that is not on the roadmap, you are doing
things in the wrong order. talk to me about your ideas for the project,
and then maybe I will consider accepting your code
* undocumented code will not be accepted. document your code!
* do not take criticism personally
